       <h1>MISERICORDAE PROJECT</h1>

<p>The two key objectives of Misericordae are focused on issues that matters most in our lives within our societies and on addressing limitations of blockchain technology.</p>
			 <ul>

				<li><b>On Societal Life Issues (SLI),</b> Misericordae aims at mitigating against threats of epidemic and pandemic outbreak, partnering with medical and care institutions including their alternatives for the old, sick and disabled, improving enhanced childcare and protection, supporting training and tech centres for skill acquisitions, and development of environment-friendly arts and technologies. As a society and as a people, we should have it in our orbit to take care of the neglected around us. It is on this basis that Misericordae also aims at implementing panaceas to the underlying root causes of: mental illness and torments, drug misuses and addictions, homelessness, and designed destitution. <b>Misericordae indefinitely welcomes anyone who wishes to join hands and participate in transforming lives around us!</b></li>

</br>
				 <li><b>On Cryptocurrency Technology Limitations (CTL),</b> Misericordae aims at its own blockchain with ONNI as the shell cryptocurrency/token pegged to the value of Gold with features that include non-linear mining difficulty to address the steady-state linearity of computing difficulty with computation speed; excess hashrate redistribution to compensate for issues of decentralization, mining farms, large mining inequalities and gain margin between CPU, GPU, FPGA and ASIC; hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake for equitability in compensation and network security between mining and holding a cryptocurrency; and most importantly to improve network security and decentralization through mining across an avalanche of algorithms. Other key features are detailed in the <a href="/whitepaper">whitepaper</a>. <b>Misericordae openly welcomes  interested developers and mining machine manufacturers to participate.</b></li>

				 <h2>NO ICO</h2>

<p>Without an ICO, the blockchain project completed its initial project phase, which involved the development and testing of Onnicoin's viability in accordance with the objectives of the blockchain. This successful proof-of concept and MVP development was conducted on Ethereum Blockchain, and Onni coin has been subsequently deployed to the mainnet. The blockchain project will be using Onni to incentivize contributions of time and efforts to ongoing development of the Misericordae blockchain. Therefore, you can earn Onnicoin through participation in the project and not through ICO. <a href="/onni"><strong>Learn more about Onni</strong></a> and <a href="/getonni"><strong>here is how to get it.</strong></a></p>
